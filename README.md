# UniversityDatabases

This project is a part of the course Databases at Aalto University. 

The report, following the required template, is quite exhaustively lengthy. Thus, I'll sum up the main points of the project below.

In short, the project illustrates a wide range of skills that are beneficial to working with Database, from RDBM, to functional dependencies, to SQL programming. Some knowledge and skills that I use for this project include:
 - Identifying primary key and constraint(s) of the classes and the relationships between them (with reasoning)
 - Representing this information using UML diagram
 - Detecting functional dependencies 
 - Using SQL for different tasks:
    + Creating a relational schema for the database - creating data tables, keys, and constraints for classes 
    + Populate the database with data
    + Information extraction - using SQL queries to get certain information, such as the IDs of students who enrolled for a course, or the course with highest number of students,... More details can be found in the "Typical use cases" section of the project report.
    + Database manipulation (Delete, Insert, Update,..)
    + To arrive to the use cases, I also utilized statements like GROUP BY, JOIN (left, right, inner), SUM, HAVING,... to analyze the database and find valuable results.
